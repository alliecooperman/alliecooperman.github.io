## Biography

Allie (she/her) is a PhD student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, where she is studying quantitative psychology and psychometric methods. Her research broadly encompasses latent variable modeling (e.g., factor analysis, item response theory), test bias, and longitudinal measurement. She is fascinated by the ways in which we can measure seemingly un-measurable constructs, and seeks to support and promote equitable measurement practices. Allie is particularly interested in the intersections of research and education policy, with a focus on using advanced quantitative methods to better understand learning and educational achievement.

Allie received her Bachelor of Art's in Psychology from Carleton College in 2013. After college, she worked as a research coordinator and data analyst in the areas of child psychopathology, family development, and early childhood education. She has co-authored numerous journal articles and national conference presentations.   

When not thinking about measurement, Allie enjoys long-distance running, weightlifting, and bagels.
